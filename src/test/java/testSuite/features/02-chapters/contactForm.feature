Feature: Contact Form operation & client-side verification
  The contact form should ensure that:
  * data is provided in all of the fields
  * the data is useful / not harmful
  * provide the user with feedback when:
  ** It does not like the user's entries
  ** The email is sent
  ** When the email is not sent

#  $nameRegex = "[A-Za-z0-9 .\-]+";
#  $maxNameLength = 40;
#  $maxEmailLength = 50;
#  $maxSubjectLength = 50;
#  $msgMaxLen = 5000;
#  $msgMinLen = 10;

#  Rule: If a message is successfully sent, the user knows it
