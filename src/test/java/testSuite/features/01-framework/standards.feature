Feature: Standards Compliance
  Syntax errors could be a reason for functional failure, so it is worth regarding this as a smoke test as well.

  Scenario Outline: CSS Compliance with W3C standards
  This is intended for testing directly created components of the SUT
  For example, Bootstrap 4' css will generate a load of error messages from this tester
    Given the w3C CSS tester reviews the file "<file>"
    Then the w3c CSS tester reports compliance
    Examples:
      | file         |
      | /index.css   |
      | /theRest.css |
