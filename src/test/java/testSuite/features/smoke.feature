Feature: SUT Page titles and delivery
  If these pages do not draw fully, then further testing is very likely to give false failures.

  Scenario Outline: Visit a page
    When I navigate to the page "<address>"
    Then the page is fully drawn
    And the page title is "Swords And Clapboards"
    Examples:
      | address                                            |
      | stage.swordsandclapboards.com/                     |
      | swordsandclapboards.com/                           |
